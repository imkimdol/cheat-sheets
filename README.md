# Cheat Sheets

This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault of cheat sheets that allows quick referencing of often-used commands, code, application/tool features, and more. 

[Original idea by Christian Lempa](https://youtu.be/cBzc5r-FNW0). [Link to his version of the repository](https://github.com/ChristianLempa/cheat-sheets).
