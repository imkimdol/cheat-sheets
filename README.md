# Cheat Sheets

This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault of cheat sheets that allows quick referencing of often-used commands, code, application/tool features, and more. 

Original idea by [Christian Lempa](https://www.youtube.com/@christianlempa). [Link to his version of the repository](https://github.com/ChristianLempa/cheat-sheets).

A YouTube video explaining entire concept can be found [here](https://youtu.be/cBzc5r-FNW0).
